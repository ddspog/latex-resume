# resume

By [ddspog](https://github.com/ddspog)

Repo for my resume versions, in different templates or
languages. All versions reads same data from a main JSON.

## Installation

Before using **resume** you need:

* Latex Engine

Setup your way of reading and compiling Latex files. Then create a
document like the other ones, choosing language and template, and
sections to add.

The information must be fetched from a common JSON, improving
consistency.
